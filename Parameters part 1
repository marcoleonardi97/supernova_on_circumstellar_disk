 In part 1, we simulated a protoplanetary disk around a primary star and a secondary star to study the latter's effects on the disk.
We varied the eccentricity of the disk and the semi-major axis values to check for different possible results.

When you run a simulation from final_code, please save the parameters you used here so we can recreate them and report them in the final paper
